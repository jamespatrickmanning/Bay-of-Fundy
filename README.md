These are notes on the BoF manuscript to be editted by JiM, Huimin, and Xiaojian via "pull request".
These notes are organized according to Figures.

     Fig 3
        needs better documentation within the code
        needs better README file
        needs explanation of where the following input files come from:
            k.npy
             latmm1.npy
            lonmm1.npy

        JiM did a "pull-request" for Huimin to consider after he cleaned up the code considerably
            he found more than 50% of the code was not needed. Many import statements and even functions appeared more than once.
        needs explanation of where the following input files come from:
            binned_drifter12078.npz (what set of programs created this binned drifter field?)
            binned_model12078.npz  (apparently FVCOM's estimate)
            current_04hind_hourly.nc (is this just April field)
